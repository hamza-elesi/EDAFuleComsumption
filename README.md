<h1>Fuel Consumption Dataset (2014) - README</h1>

<p>This repository contains a dataset of Fuel Consumption in Canada for the year 2014. The dataset aims to facilitate the prediction of CO2 emissions based on various factors related to vehicle specifications and fuel consumption. It includes information on different attributes such as model year, make, model, vehicle class, engine size, cylinders, transmission, fuel type, fuel consumption in the city, fuel consumption on the highway, combined fuel consumption, fuel consumption in miles per gallon (MPG), and CO2 emissions.

<h2>Dataset Details</h2>
<h3>The dataset provides the following information for each vehicle entry:</h3>
<p>
MODELYEAR: The model year of the vehicle (e.g., 2014).
MAKE: The manufacturer or brand of the vehicle.
MODEL: The specific model of the vehicle.
VEHICLECLASS: The classification of the vehicle (e.g., SUV, sedan, truck).
ENGINESIZE: The size of the vehicle's engine in liters.
CYLINDERS: The number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine.
TRANSMISSION: The type of transmission system used in the vehicle.
FUELTYPE: The fuel type used by the vehicle (e.g., gasoline, diesel).
FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY: The fuel consumption in liters per 100 kilometers in city driving conditions.
FUELCONSUMPTION_HWY: The fuel consumption in liters per 100 kilometers on the highway.
FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB: The combined fuel consumption in liters per 100 kilometers (combining city and highway driving).
FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB_MPG: The combined fuel consumption in miles per gallon (MPG).
CO2EMISSIONS: The CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer produced by the vehicle.
